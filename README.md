**Simple Flutter College Project**
- Welcome to the Simple Flutter College Project repository! This project is a basic Flutter application developed for a college assignment. While the initial version consists of a simple app with just three pages, I have plans to expand and improve it over time.

**About the Project**
- This repository contains a Flutter app written in Dart using Android Studio as the development environment. The app currently consists of three main pages, serving as a foundation for future enhancements and features.

**Features**
- Three Main Pages: The app includes three distinct pages, providing a basic structure for further development.
- Flutter & Dart: Developed using Flutter framework with Dart programming language.
- Android Studio: Built using Android Studio IDE for Flutter development.

**Future Plans**
While the project is currently in its early stages, I intend to:
- Add more features and functionalities.
- Improve the user interface and experience.
- Optimize the codebase for better performance and maintainability.
