# Simple Flutter College Project

Simple Flutter College Project is a basic Flutter application developed for a college assignment. While the initial version consists of a simple app with just three pages, there are plans to expand and improve it over time.

## About the Project

This repository contains a Flutter app written in Dart using Android Studio as the development environment. The app currently consists of three main pages, serving as a foundation for future enhancements and features.

## Features

- Three Main Pages: The app includes three distinct pages, providing a basic structure for further development.
- Flutter & Dart: Developed using the Flutter framework with the Dart programming language.
- Android Studio: Built using the Android Studio IDE for Flutter development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-flutter-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd simple-flutter-project
    ```

3. Build the project:

    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```

4. Run the app:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

- Open the project in Android Studio and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
- Navigate through the three main pages to explore the app's functionality.

## Future Plans

While the project is currently in its early stages, there are plans to:
- Add more features and functionalities.
- Improve the user interface and experience.
- Optimize the codebase for better performance and maintainability.

## Note:
- I will probably change the project with Personal Trainer content for our final output for one of my major subjects. However, since that is a Forms/SQL output, this one will be made as a mobile app.
